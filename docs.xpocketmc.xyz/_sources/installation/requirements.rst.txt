Setup requirements
------------------
A computer or device with the following is required:

* 64-bit CPU
* 64-bit operating system
* 1GB RAM or better

The following are not requirements, but recommended:

* Dual-core or better CPU

.. note::
	XPocketMP is notoriously bad at multi-core usage. If purchasing a machine to run XPocketMP on, prefer higher CPU frequency instead of lots of cores.

We officially try to support Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms. However, in general any platform which will run 64-bit PHP with the required extensions will work.
